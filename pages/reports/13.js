        <p>
        We are officially less than a week away from the TIE Corp's biggest competition of the year. The final rules and point system for Raise The Flag should be settled in the coming days. 
        I'm confident that Sin is going to represent the Warrior well and put up a great showing. I hope you all are excited as I am to participate. Don't forget that next Saturday will be the first meeting for
         Sinfantry Training. We will most likely be doing PvP in Star Conflict and Battlefront 2. I look forward to flying with you all. 
        </p>
        <p>I also want to shout out and give a huge congrats to Commander Kazraran and Captain SkyShadow on the promotions that they earned earlier in the week. Very well deserved to the both of you. </p>

      We are entering the last days of the month. I will be working MSEs later this week. After a quick glance, it looks like many of you will be receiving a merit award for September. Please check in with your Flight Leaders and let 
      them know what competitions you have participated in along with other things that could earn you MSE points. 
      <p>For Sin!</p>
