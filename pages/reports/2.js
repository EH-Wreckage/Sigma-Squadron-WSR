        <center><h4>Squadron Commander's Speech</h4></center>
        <p>
        Good Morning, Good Afternoon, or Good Evening Sinners... Wherever you are. This last week has 
        been crazy, especially the previous three days. As you all know we had entered our first battle 
        of Imperial Storm with The Hammer. The Battle of Bunduki will go down as one of the bloodiest 
        battles of history. The Warrior fleet was outnumbered but that did not stop us from putting up 
        one helluva fight.  While we may end up losing the battle due to having a smaller fleet, we caused 
        a lot of damage to the Hammer, and the war is far from over. The Warrior also made a statement that 
        we will not be defeated easily, no matter the disadvantage. I really need to emphasis how happy I am 
        from the performance that our Squadron did in this battle. Over 830 Legions came from our squad alone, 
        that is awesome. Thank you again to everyone who contributed to our efforts. 
        </p>

        <p>Today is CM SkyShadows birthday, so make sure to wish him a very Happy Birthday and buy him a beer 
          while you are at it.
        </p>

        <p>
        SL Caleb Watson was recently sent to the reserves due to non comunication and inactivity. However as you may 
        all already know we have a new member in our squad, Sub-Lieutenant AlexanderK9. He has wasted no time flying with a few of us in Star Conflict, 
        and has earned several Legion of Skirmishes. His paperwork for his promotion to Full Lieutenant is in the mail. If you need a wingman, hes your guy. 
        </p>

        <p>Just a reminder, my first Sin competitioin "What's your PoiSIN?" is live.
        </p>

        <i>	"Sinfire Cantina has just opened up on the ISD Warrior and it needs some new drink ideas. It canâ€™t just serve Zekks 
          on the Beach and Sinfire shots all day, we need some variety. Create a drink after yourself or Sin Squadron, and provide 
          the ingredients and possibly even a photo or graphic of the drink. Zekk and I will judge based on creativity, details, 
          and graphics provided. IS-SR for 1st place, IS-BR for 2nd place and IS-CR for all other pilots who provide a drink name, 
          ingredients, and a graphic."</i>

      <Closing>
      One of the benifits of taking over the squadron right when Imperial Storm started was that I got the chance 
      to fly with many of you and other Warrior pilots for the first time. This week was crazy, but still I had alot fun. 
      Thanks for all the games, I look forward to going into battle with you all again.


      <p>For Sin!</p>
