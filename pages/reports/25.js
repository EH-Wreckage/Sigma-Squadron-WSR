            Silwar docked his TIE Defender in the rafters of the Challenge's main hangar and
            climbed out of the top hatch. Tempest squadron had just returned from a successful
            attack on a Munificent-class frigate; you don't see many of them nowadays, but they
            can still pack a punch. Of course, the ship posed no problem for Tempest's pilots, who
            had taken advantage of its lowered rear shields and destroyed it within moments of
            launching a volley of torpoedoes from its missile boats. Silwar took a moment to
            consider the loss of LT Rhygaar, who had only recently been assigned to the squadron,
            before walking the pathways to his office; the pilot showed promise but didn't spend
            enough time in the simulators, and it showed. He would make sure the same fate didn't
            meet the rest of his squadron.

          LCM Marek has moved into a flight member position while on leave,
          and LCM Richlet has taken his spot as the lead of flight two. We've also gained a new
          member, SL Morgoth, who has flown with EchoVII, Richlet, and myself in several
          Squadrons matches admirably. Lastly, LT Rhygaar has moved to the reserves.

          "It was so hard picking a winner. Everyone's entries look so good!", said Neko. I
          agree! I'll post a gallery of all entries soon. We had eight entries, so an IS-GR,
          IS-SR, and IS-BR have all been recommended.
