        <p>
          Congraulations are in order for CM Neko, LCM Honsou, and LCM Wreckage, who each earned
          promotions this week. For this briefest of moments, they shall share the tab at the
          cantina. All three are highly deserved, and their efforts to further the squadron, the
          TIE Corps, and the Empire have not gone unnoticed.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few new awards have started to show up in pilots' profiles: the IS-CR and IS-CW, or
          the "Copper" variant of Iron Stars, are awarded for achieving a non-placement milestone
          in a competition. We've seen some IS-CWs go out this week for Chalquilla Cup contestants
          whose teams earned at least 80 kills, for example. Another new award is the IAR. "Used to
          recognize short-term bursts of activity, the Imperial Achievement Ribbon is awarded to
          members that exert effort beyond the normal scope of their duties worthy of being
          mentioned in a dispatch." LC Phalk Sturm and LCM Wreckage have been the first recipients
          of the IAR, and I expect to see many more in Tempest soon.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Chalquilla Cup has finally been declared finished, with Firebird at the top of the
          pile. MAJ Genie and I are planning an awards ceremony for this Sunday at 4pm EDT / 9pm
          BST. It's hopefully late enough not to interfere with any Cadet Cup games, but we will
          postpone if necessary. LCM Wreckage (ne√© Wrecker) has organized a Tempest squadron team,
          the Storm Knights. The TIE Corps as a whole is also fielding several other teams - we
          wish them luck as well!
        </p>

        <p>
          In additional competitive news, our Squadrons Premier League team went 30-29 against
          the Murder Hornets, beating them twice in extremely close matches. You can watch the
          {' recording on '}
          <Link href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/999911027?t=0h5m54s">my stream</Link>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Tempest Squadron logo has had a minor update, thanks to the work of CPT Kalve Ryder
          and LCM Morgoth. It now features the new TC logo and an updated shade of blue. It is at
          {'the top of this report, or you can view it in high-resolution '}

        <p>
          Firebird Squadron training, a Squadrons PvP event for all Challenge pilots, will resume
          May 2nd at 4pm EST / 9pm BST. See COL Stryker for more details.
